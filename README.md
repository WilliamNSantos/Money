# Money
Imagine the situation, you are driving a car on a highway. But, you don't have any meter of nothing. You don't know your speed, oil pressure, temperature, gas, nothing. Quite exciting, living on the edge. This is exactly how your finances are if you don't use any system to have control. As I say, it's simple to solve this situation, just use a system, any one. So you will be able to have control of your finances as your car. Then let's thinking a little, if you could use any system, why not use an open-source system that you could improve with me and then release to your family and friends? If you buy the idea, help me build this amazing system together. Otherwise, find another system, but what really matters is to use something to have control of your finances! Thanks for reading.
